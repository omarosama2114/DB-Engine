# DB-Engine
The goal of this project was to develop a database engine in Java that leverages octree indices to improve the speed and efficiency of data access. The database engine was designed to handle large datasets efficiently while providing fast retrieval and storage operations.Throughout the project, we conducted extensive testing to evaluate the performance and scalability of our database engine with octree indices. We benchmarked the system against various datasets and query workloads, measuring the efficiency of spatial queries and comparing it to traditional indexing approaches. Performance metrics, such as query response time and throughput, were analyzed to validate the effectiveness of the implemented octree indices.
